This year the course is being delivered by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/">Giles Reger</a>, <a href="https://ssvlab.github.io/lucasccordeiro/">Lucas Cordeiro</a>, and Peter Lammich

<H2><font color="blue">Aims<font color="black"></H2>

The course aims to: 
<ul>
<li> Help you become confident with a range of data structures and algorithms and able to apply them in a realistic way</li>
<li> Give you the tools required to analyse a problem and decide which algorithms or algorithmic techniques to apply (we refer to this as <i>algorithmic literacy</i>)</li>
<li> Emphasise practical concerns rahter than mathematical analysis</li>
<li> Introduce you to C by applying it to solve new problems</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The course is arranged differently from some other courses. To reflect its practical nature there is one laboratory session (2 hours) per week and one lecture (1 hour) per week. 
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Warning<font color="black">: Lectures <i>do not provide all the information</i> you will need for
the course, or to complete the laboratory exercises. You are expected
to read additional material - this is part of developing algorithmic
literacy. Lectures will cover the main algorithmic techniques and concepts but you will be required to explore these further.

<H2><A NAME=ACTIVITIES><font color="blue">General Arrangements<font color="black"></A></H2>

<p>
Normally, there will be ONE laboratory session and ONE lecture per week. The schedule is given in detail below.
</p>
<h4>Laboratory sessions</h4>

<p>Labs are there for you to have your work marked and to ask questions to better understand the material. In addition to the <a href="https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php?title=UGHandbook19:Coursework">General Lab Instructions</a> (which you need to read), there are some specific 26120 instructions due to the use of the <a href="https://marking.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">COMPjudge</a> system form marking.</p>  

<p> The workflow for submission and marking is as follows: 
<ul>
<li> Follow the <a href="https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php?title=UGHandbook19:Coursework">general instructions for submitting via Gitlab</a> e.g. each exercise should be completed in its own branch. In addition to these instructions, for each new exercise you should
<ul>
<li> To start, run <tt>git checkout <i>ex-short-name</i></tt> where <i>ex-short-name</i> is, for example, ex3 
<li> Immediately after this, run <tt>./refresh.sh</tt> - this rebases your branch on top of the original repository and ensures that the starting material is up-to-date in case any changes were made since the initial fork. Always run this at the start of each lab. Running this after you have started may require you to resolve conflicts.</li>
<li> Once you have finished (or want COMPjudge to run tests) run <tt>./submit.sh</tt> - this script adds a tag to your last commit and pushes this. If submission is not working try reading the comments in <tt>./submit.sh</tt></li> 
</ul>
These two scripts should already be in the repository.</li>
<br>
<li> Once your work has been submitted, COMPjudge will pick it up, compile it, and run some automated tests on your code to produce a report. The workflow surrounding COMPjudge is as follows:
<ul>
<li> You can log in to <a href="https://marking.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">COMPjudge</a> to view the reports of your submitted code (you can also use this to check that the submission worked)
<li> In your marking session, when you want to be marked you should select <i>request marking</i> next to the exercise in the online system and enter your information
<li> TAs will be notified that you are ready to be marked and use their version of your report (which may contain extra bits) to mark your work
<li> Once the TAs submit your mark you should receive an email confirming it (if you do not please contact the course unit leader but wait a few hours first)
<li> Note that the electronic marking queue aims to distribute TAs uniformly between students and gives priority to those being marked for the correct exercise in the correct marking session (if you go to the wrong marking session you will be at the end of the queue)
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Attendance in labs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We will collect attendance in labs
<li>Attendance is not mandatory (there are no marks attached to it) but is strongly encouraged and missing a lab may lead to you not getting marked (see marking deadline below). 
<li>As attendance is not mandatory we will not normally update a record of missed attendance but you can talk to the lab manager if you need to do this for some reason. 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deadlines</h4>

<p><b>Important:</b> In this course (for the first time) we have placed the deadlines <em>after</em> we expect you to have completed the work and had the work marked. <b>Our expectation is that you complete work <em>before</em> the next lab session and attempt to get marked in this next lab session.</b> If you repeatedly wait until the deadline to submit you will fall behind with work and will run the risk of missing marking deadlines (see below). Therefore, the deadline is there as a final encouragement to complete work that you should already have completed.
</p> 
 
<p>
All lab groups share the same deadline of the end of the week following the last lab session (e.g. Friday at 6pm). 
In certain cases this may not be the next week (e.g. for reading week). At the end of Semester 1 we allow some overlap with the beginning of Semester 2. Check the official pages (and COMPjudge) for the actual deadlines. 
</p>
<p>
As per general School policy, we do not issue extensions for individuals but late flags may be removed via the standard mitigating circumstances procedure. In exceptional circumstances the deadline may be extended and in such cases you will be informed - see <a href="https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php?title=UGHandbook19:Coursework">here</a> for the rules and a link to the form. 
</p>
<p>
If you decide to complete
the exercise after the labs shut in the evening, it is your responsibility
to make sure that you can submit remotely.
</p>
<p>
As well as the standard submission deadline, there is a marking deadline: <font color="red">All exercises should be marked in the 3 Labs after the last lab session on that exercise. COMPjudge contains details of marking deadlines.<font color="black">. The reason for the marking deadline is to encourage you to get your work marked as soon after you complete it as possible and to balance time available for marking. 
</p>
<p>Submissions not marked by this deadline will only be marked at the discretion of the lab manager. For example, if a lab has a deadline at the end of week 2 you can have it marked in weeks 2, 3, or 4. The marking deadline may be relaxed if there is too much demand in labs. The best way to avoid this is to have your work marked in the week in which you submitted it. If you turn up to the lab and join the marking queue and still do not get marked then your individual marking deadline will automatically extend until the end of your next lab.

<!--
<H3>Guidance for the January Examination</H3>

<p>Format: 1.5 hour exam: 2 questions, answer both.</p>

<p>The material covered in this exam is that of Semester 1, except that the C
programming language is not examined (it is assessed in the laboratory
exercises instead). Thus the exam (broadly) covers the Divide and Conquer paradigm, Algorithmic Complexity, Sorting Algorithms, and (Advanced) Data Structures. Remember that topics from lectures <b>and</b> labs are examinable and some of these topics required further reading in the course textbook. 
</p>

<p>The syllabus is defined by the distributed material, which may
contain references to specific  sections of the
coursebook that it is necessary to read. It is expected that you do this reading. Bear in mind that lectures are for getting a
general understanding of a particular topic; textbooks are for details. 
In a very few cases, the indicated sections of the
textbook contain explanations of specific topics not addressed 
in the lectures. In such cases, it is
reasonable to suppose that detailed questions about this material will
not appear on the examination. On the other hand, understanding general techniques and method of
approach is likely to be useful in answering examination questions.
<p>
As always, the advice on scheduling revision is to start by getting a good general
appreciation of the topics, and then progressively to deepen one's
understanding. Never bet on a particular topic occurring: only a part
of what we covered can be examined.
-->
<!--
<H3>Guidance for the May/June Examination</H3>

<P>
The examination is 2 hours in duration, with 3 sections. You are asked to answer all uestions. The sections are weighted as follows:
<ul>
<li>Section A: Graphs and Graph Algorithms [20 marks]
<li>Section B: Complexity and NP completeness [10 marks]
<li>Section C: Algorithmic Techniques and Number Theoretic Algorithms [30 marks]
</ul> 
</P>
<P>
You will need to know the material from both semesters to answer the questions successfully - Part C may make use of this material in its algorithmic design questions.

<H2>Guidance for Resits</H2>

<p>
If, after the summer examinations, you have performed poorly overall and also in this course unit, you may be asked to resit
this course unit (either the laboratory exercises, the examination, or both). Here are some guidelines for your resits.
</p>
<p>
If you have to retake <font color="red">laboratory exercises<font color="black">, marking sessions will be arranged in the resit period (see below for arrangements for resitting laboratory exercises).
</p>
<p>
<b><font color="red">Assessment<font color="black"></b>: To pass this course unit at the resit stage, 
your resit course-unit mark will be calculated as follows.
<DL>

<DT>50% Resit Exam mark<DD>
<P>
Your marks from the January and May/June exams will be ignored, and you
have to resit the exam even if you did well in one or both of the earlier
exams.
<P>
The resit exam will have the same scope (i.e. revise the whole year, not just one semester) as the
May/June exam (see above).
<P>
The Guidance for the summer (May/June) examination above is still relevant, though the format may be different.
</P>

<DT>50% Laboratory mark<DD>
<P>
If part of the reason for you having to resit is that you failed the lab,
you should try to improve your lab marks by attempting some of the lab
exercises you didn't do (and/or maybe try to improve your marks for lab
exercises you did badly in).
<P>
Unless you have mitigating circumstances, late laboratory work will be limited to
a maximum 40% as usual. We will apply this cut-off to the year as a whole,
not to individual exercises or semesters, so one strategy would be to
attempt most or all of the first semester lab exercises and perhaps also
some second semester lab exercises. 
<BR>
<B>If you do have mitigating circumstances (e.g. medical problems), we
may be able to give you full marks for extra lab work, please make sure
that we are aware of this.</B>

<P>
If you do more lab work, you should submit it in the usual way. All resit laboratory solutions should be submitted  <b>before the resit examination period
starts. <font color="red">This is a hard deadline<font color="black"></b>. </p>
<p>
We will arrange a <font color="blue">marking session<font color="black"> around the time of the exams: look out for the
announcement via email to your school account (you should make sure you read this, or forward messages to an account you read).
To get your exercises marked you <b>must</b> attend the marking session and should be prepared to make arrangements to do so.
