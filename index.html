This year the course is being delivered by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/">Giles Reger</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~milan/">Milan Mihajlovic</a> and <a href="https://ssvlab.github.io/lucasccordeiro/">Lucas Cordeiro</a>.

<H2><font color="blue">Aims<font color="black"></H2>

The course aims to: 
<ul>
<li> Help you become confident with a range of data structures and algorithms and able to apply them in a realistic way</li>
<li> Give you the tools required to analyse a problem and decide which algorithms or algorithmic techniques to apply (we refer to this as <i>algorithmic literacy</i>)</li>
<li> Emphasise practical concerns rahter than mathematical analysis</li>
<li> Introduce you to C by applying it to solve new problems</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The course is arranged differently from some other courses. To reflect its practical nature there is one laboratory session (2 hours) per week and one lecture (1 hour) per week. 
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">Warning<font color="black">: Lectures <i>do not provide all the information</i> you will need for
the course, or to complete the laboratory exercises. You are expected
to read additional material - this is part of developing algorithmic
literacy. Lectures will cover the main algorithmic techniques and concepts but you will be required to explore these further.

<H2><A NAME=ACTIVITIES><font color="blue">General Arrangements<font color="black"></A></H2>

<p>
Normally, there will be ONE laboratory session and ONE lecture per week. The schedule is given in detail below.
</p>
<h4>Laboratory sessions</h4>

<p>Labs are there for you to have your work marked and to ask questions to better understand the material. This year we are introducing a new marking system that will be used as follows:
<ul>
<li> To submit an exercise you will need to run <tt>submit</tt> from the command line as normal
<li> Once this has been submitted our system will pick it up, compile it, and run some automated tests on your code to produce a report
<li> You can log in to <a href="https://marking.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">the system</a> to view the reports of your submitted code (you can also use this to check that the submission worked)
<li> In your marking session, when you want to be marked you should select <i>request marking</i> next to the exercise in the online system and enter your information
<li> TAs will be notified that you are ready to be marked and use their version of your report (which may contain extra bits) to mark your work
<li> Once the TAs submit your mark you should receive an email confirming it (if you do not please contact the course unit leader but wait a few hours first)
<li> Note that the electronic marking queue aims to distribute TAs uniformly between students and gives priority to those being marked for the correct exercise in the correct marking session (if you go to the wrong marking session you will be at the end of the queue)
</ul>

<p>
Attendance in labs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We will collect attendance in labs and this will appear in ARCADE
<li>Attendance is not mandatory (there are no marks attached to it) but is strongly encouraged and missing a lab may lead to you not getting marked (see marking deadline below). 
<li>If you wish to ammend your ARCADE entry then you should talk to the lab manager in your lab session. If you miss a session for a legitimate reason (because of, for example, medical appointments, interviews, etc, or illness) and need to marked in a later session then talk to the lab manager and they will be able to remove you from the bottom of the marking queue</li>
<li> Only in exceptional circumstances contact a member of staff for these issues - ordinary messages will be ignored. 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deadlines</h4>

<p>
Each laboratory exercise has a standard deadline of <i>the beginning of the next lab session</i>. For example, if your lab sessions are 11:00-13:00 on Tuesdays then the deadline for the Week 2 lab is 11:00 on the Tuesday of Week 3. In certain cases the next lab session may not be the next week (e.g. for reading week). At the end of the Semester the next lab session is the first one of the next Semester. As per general School policy, there are no extensions and late flags should be removed via the standard mitigating circumstances procedure.
</p>
<p>
If you decide to complete
the exercise after the labs shut in the evening, it is your responsibility
to make sure that you can submit remotely.
</p>
<p>
As well as the standard submission deadline, there is a marking deadline: <font color="red">All exercises should be marked within 3 LABS of the submission deadline<font color="black">. Submissions not marked by this deadline will only be marked at the discretion of the lab manager. For example, if you submit something in week 2 you can have it marked in weeks 2, 3, or 4. The marking deadline may be relaxed if there is too much demand in labs. The best way to avoid this is to have your work marked in the week in which you submitted it. If you turn up to the lab and join the marking queue and still do not get marked then your individual marking deadline will automatically extend until the end of your next lab.
</p>

<h4>Tutorials</h4> 
<p>There are tutorial sessions associated with this course. Here are the tutorial sheets:
<ul>
<li>  <A HREF=tutorials/string-matching-tut.pdf>Tutorial sheet 1</A> You need to prepare a presentation, using the resources on String Matching above. </li>
<li> <A HREF=tutorials/knapsack.pdf>Tutorial sheet 2</A> This tutorial is preparation for the lab exercise on Knapsack Problems. You should therefore prepare the tutorial well ahead of Sem 2: Weeks 5/6. </li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
Lectures start in Week 1, Laboratory exercises in Week 2.

<a href="UseOfOthersCode.html">Policy on use of code from outside sources</a>
(downloaded from the internet, etc). <font color="red">Warning<font color="black">: Plagarism and collusion detectors may be run on your answers and disciplinary action taken. </li>
</p>
<p>
For suggested reading we use GT for <i>Algorithm Design</i> (core text), CLRS for <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, and DD for <i>C How to Program</i>. Note that for non-core-text material (CLRS and DD) this is <i>suggested</i> in the sense that it will help but is not core. </p>
<p>All quizes are on Blackboard and will have a deadline on midnight on the Sunday at the end of the week. However, note that if there is a problem with Blackboard after 4pm on Friday you will not be able to get any help with this.</p>

<H3>Guidance for the January Examination</H3>

<p>Format: 1.5 hour exam: 2 questions, answer both.</p>

<p>The material covered in this exam is that of Semester 1, except that the C
programming language is not examined (it is assessed in the laboratory
exercises instead). Thus the exam (broadly) covers the Divide and Conquer paradigm, Algorithmic Complexity, Sorting Algorithms, and (Advanced) Data Structures. Remember that topics from lectures <b>and</b> labs are examinable and some of these topics required further reading in the course textbook. 
</p>

<p>The syllabus is defined by the distributed material, which may
contain references to specific  sections of the
coursebook that it is necessary to read. It is expected that you do this reading. Bear in mind that lectures are for getting a
general understanding of a particular topic; textbooks are for details. 
In a very few cases, the indicated sections of the
textbook contain explanations of specific topics not addressed 
in the lectures. In such cases, it is
reasonable to suppose that detailed questions about this material will
not appear on the examination. On the other hand, understanding general techniques and method of
approach is likely to be useful in answering examination questions.
<p>
As always, the advice on scheduling revision is to start by getting a good general
appreciation of the topics, and then progressively to deepen one's
understanding. Never bet on a particular topic occurring: only a part
of what we covered can be examined.


<H3>Guidance for the May/June Examination</H3>

<P>
The examination is 2 hours in duration, with 3 sections. You are asked to answer all uestions. The sections are weighted as follows:
<ul>
<li>Section A: Graphs and Graph Algorithms [20 marks]
<li>Section B: Complexity and NP completeness [10 marks]
<li>Section C: Algorithmic Techniques and Number Theoretic Algorithms [30 marks]
</ul> 
</P>
<P>
You will need to know the material from both semesters to answer the questions successfully -- Part C may make use of this material in its algorithmic design questions.

<H2>Guidance for Resits</H2>

<p>
If, after the summer examinations, you have performed poorly overall and also in this course unit, you may be asked to resit
this course unit (either the laboratory exercises, the examination, or both). Here are some guidelines for your resits.
</p>
<p>
If you have to retake <font color="red">laboratory exercises<font color="black">, marking sessions will be arranged in the resit period (see below for arrangements for resitting laboratory exercises).
</p>
<p>
<b><font color="red">Assessment<font color="black"></b>: To pass this course unit at the resit stage, 
your resit course-unit mark will be calculated as follows.
<DL>

<DT>50% Resit Exam mark<DD>
<P>
Your marks from the January and May/June exams will be ignored, and you
have to resit the exam even if you did well in one or both of the earlier
exams.
<P>
The resit exam will have the same scope (i.e. revise the whole year, not just one semester) as the
May/June exam (see above).
<P>
The Guidance for the summer (May/June) examination above is still relevant, though the format may be different.
</P>

<DT>50% Laboratory mark<DD>
<P>
If part of the reason for you having to resit is that you failed the lab,
you should try to improve your lab marks by attempting some of the lab
exercises you didn't do (and/or maybe try to improve your marks for lab
exercises you did badly in).
<P>
Unless you have mitigating circumstances, late laboratory work will be limited to
a maximum 40% as usual. We will apply this cut-off to the year as a whole,
not to individual exercises or semesters, so one strategy would be to
attempt most or all of the first semester lab exercises and perhaps also
some second semester lab exercises. 
<BR>
<B>If you do have mitigating circumstances (e.g. medical problems), we
may be able to give you full marks for extra lab work, please make sure
that we are aware of this.</B>

<P>
If you do more lab work, you should submit it in the usual way. All resit laboratory solutions should be submitted  <b>before the resit examination period
starts. <font color="red">This is a hard deadline<font color="black"></b>. </p>
<p>
We will arrange a <font color="blue">marking session<font color="black"> around the time of the exams: look out for the
announcement via email to your school account (you should make sure you read this, or forward messages to an account you read).
To get your exercises marked you <b>must</b> attend the marking session and should be prepared to make arrangements to do so.
